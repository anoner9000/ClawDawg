Clawdex fetch + ClawHavoc scan report

Fetched: https://clawdex.koi.security/skill.md (archived)

Scans performed (2026-02-03 02:23 - 02:27 CT):
- Content-scan for risky install instructions (curl | bash, glot.io, password-protected zip): No matches in local README/install docs.
- Targeted README/install-docs scan: No risky install instructions found.
- Retroactive IOC/name/hash/IP scan:
  - Skill name/pattern matches: none found in ~/.openclaw, ~/.clawdbot, ~/.npm-global, workspace.
  - IOC IP addresses: none found in scanned files or logs.
  - SHA256 file hash matches: none found for supplied hashes.
  - Active network connections to IOC IPs: none observed.
  - Bash history: no suspicious download commands found.

Actions taken:
- Archived Clawdex docs to playbooks/secure/clawdex/skill.md
- Saved scan results and notes to memory/2026-02-03.md
- Prepared playbooks/token_rotation_playbook.md and backup scripts for next steps (dry-run capable)

Notes/next steps:
- Nightly ACE ingestion (dry-run) and weekly deep audits continue.
- If you want, I can collect a forensic snapshot (process list, /tmp/ & home modtimes, recent logs) and store it under playbooks/secure/clawdex/artifacts.tar.gz
- No destructive or quarantine actions were performed; further containment requires explicit approval.
