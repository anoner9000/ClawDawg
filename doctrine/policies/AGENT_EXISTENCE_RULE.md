# AGENT EXISTENCE RULE

Status: Canonical
Applies to: All agents, all models, all execution contexts in OpenClaw

An agent is considered to exist only if:

1) A directory exists at `agents/<agent_name>/`, and
2) `agents/<agent_name>/SOUL.md` exists.

Session keys, templates, examples, demos, prior conversations, or inferred rosters do not constitute agents.
