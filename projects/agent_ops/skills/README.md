# Skills Layer (agent_ops)

## Purpose
- Skills are the executable SOP layer for `agent_ops` workflows.
- Source documents under `onboarding/`, `scorecards/`, and `bus/` remain canonical references.

## How to use
- Select a versioned skill folder under `skills/`.
- Run procedure and guardrails from that skill's `SKILL.md`.
- Write evidence and outcomes into referenced canonical artifacts.

## Versioning approach
- Use foldered semantic versions by capability (example: `scribe_onboarding_v1`).
- Create a new folder (for example `scribe_onboarding_v2`) for breaking workflow changes.
- Keep prior versions intact for reproducibility and audit trails.
