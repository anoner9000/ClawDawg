  "title": "Review heartbeat_aggregator.sh for provenance & gating",
  "description": "Validate that heartbeat_aggregator.sh enforces provenance invariants, enqueues proposals only after checks, records accounting_incomplete flags on append failures, and calls rate_guard on 429s. Produce a concise checklist, any small fixes as a proposed diff, and verification commands.",
