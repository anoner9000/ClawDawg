You just had the perfect day with your AI assistant. It did the donkey work of downloading and transcribing everything you've ever written (or said). Now you can confidently reference your own words and ideas more readily. And know your AI assistant knows everything you've ever said publicly. Amazing. You go to bed smiling. Then you wake up, and the AI acts like you've never met before. What went wrong? AI has bad memory. And since AI has bad memory, it needs a better retrieval. Your AI needs a better home If you use Obsidian or another linked-based tool, you have felt the power of an ideaverse. It represents something we deeply crave but have lost in our new reality of endless information: a dedicated space to think in. And it turns out... It's not just us who need an ideaverse, our AI's need one too. In fact, it's vital for your AI—and your working relationship with it. Why? Because it gives you both a shared home. Use ACE as a shared mental model There are three organizational frames we use to make sense of the world: idea, time, and action. Each of these can be represented by a base level folder to support your AI. That's what ACE provides you and your AI: a universal mental model for knowledge management. Here's the quick reference (NOTE: copy and paste this whole article into AI to get started.) Quick Reference: Atlas is for timeless knowledge (contains notes on ideas, sources, people, etc.) Calendar is for time-based information (contains daily notes, plans, and logs) Efforts is for time-bound information (contains projects, works, and areas of effort) Plus two supporting spaces: A + folder for what's new in time (contains new, unsorted notes) An x folder for extras, things neutral in time (contains templates, images, assets, documentation) Why Your AI Assistant Needs ACE There are three areas where ACE is uniquely suited for the structure of a shared workspace with AI. 1) AI needs a place for Ideas AND Projects I cringe when I see systems built solely around productivity. Folks, there is more to life than projects! If you have a project-based view of the world, your life becomes less enriched. You suffer from a minor case of the Hormozi Paradox: so focused on winning finite games that you can't even comprehend the infinite games (even when Tony Robbins keeps nudging you to open your eyes). That's a poor mental model. ACE treats knowledge and action as equals: Atlas is for ideas that matter for their own sake—concepts you're developing, people you know, maps that help you think. Not everything is a damn project. Efforts is for your work—projects with deadlines, areas you maintain, works you ship. 2) AI needs a place for Daily Notes It is crucial that your AI logs what happens each day. It's for both your sakes. And if that log isn't in your shared Ideaverse, it's a huge mistake. if that place to take daily notes isn't clearly marked, it's a huge mistake. ACE gives daily notes a clear place, so that both you and your AI can easily add and review these notes to regain needed context. Again, in lieu of AI having great memory, we need to give it great retrieval. Calendar is for daily notes and logs of what work was done, or what was talked about. The better the "I read the recent daily notes and have all the context," replies, the better your experience and outcomes with be. 3) AI is much stronger with Folders AND LINKS AI benefits tremendously from linked notes. If I say, "Go to project XYZ and refresh yourself," and it goes to the project and sees that it's linked to five other nodes, well, let's just say the AI is comprehensively refreshed. Unlike other folder systems, ACE was built to work seamlessly with both links and folders. Folders give you stability. A note lives in one place. You always know where to find it. Links give you emergence. Ideas connect across boundaries. A person in the Atlas folder can easily be linked to a project in Efforts. Any daily note can easily link to a project you've that been working on for months.ACE uses folders for the primary structure—via the three orientations of ACE—and it uses links for the connective tissue. I'm telling you, it feels great to know you can just link out from a note. And whenever AI looks at that note, it has all the relevant context that it can dive into if and when it needs to go deeper. That's the magic of...am I really going to say it...of linking your thinking. How to get your AI started with ACE These are the basic steps. 1) Create your shared ideaverse Create a new Obsidian vault, call it something like R2's Ideaverse, and set up the folders. +, Atlas, Calendar, Efforts, and x. 2) Start adding a few entities. One project in Efforts. One timeless concept in Atlas. 3) Feed your AI this living document After you set up the ACE folder framework, you need a document to help orient your AI. Give it this entire article for starters. But then, you'll want to craft shared documentation that you can both use together. Here's how mine starts: This is a living document capturing how to work within the ACE system. Both R2 and I will keep it updated. Our shared mental model is ACE. Here's how it works: Three headspaces: Atlas = Knowledge (what you know) Calendar = Time (what happened, what's coming) Efforts = Action (what you're doing) Plus two supporting folders: + = Capture (only if truly unsure where it goes) x = System (templates, packs, visuals, system documentation) 4) Iterate it with your AI. My living document guiding my AI goes into many other sections beyond the scope of this overview, but just make sure you and your AI go over the following together: Metadata Patterns When and how do we use which note templates? Use Cases: What particular use cases does the human have that we need to figure out together how to organize with ACE? Workflow Patterns: What does the nature and scope of our work look like? MOCs and Project notes: When do we want to create a map of content? When do we want to create a project note? Have it ask questions. Give it your custom, idiosyncratic guidance. Together, you'll have built an AI assistant who may have poor memory, but excellent ability to re-upload what matters. Your AI improves when you have a shared language ACE is more than a folder system. It's a shared language. It's a recognition that human thinking operates in three modes: Atlas for knowing (timeless) Calendar for reflecting & logging (time-based) Efforts for acting & doing (time-bound) Your AI assistant should honor all three. Most knowledge systems make everything projects, projects projects...everything is a task, a project, a thing to do. But that's not Life, and that's not how our minds work. Sometimes you're learning. Sometimes you're reflecting or remembering. Sometimes you're doing. ACE gives a space for each. It gives a shared language and a shared home for both you and your AI.
