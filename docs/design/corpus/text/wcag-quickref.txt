Principle 1
– Perceivable
Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
Guideline
1.1
– Text Alternatives
Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be changed into other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols or simpler language.
1.1.1
Non-text Content
Level A
All non-text content that is presented to the user has a text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose, except for the situations listed below.
Controls, Input:
If non-text content is a control or accepts user input, then it has a name that describes its purpose. (Refer to Success Criterion 4.1.2 for additional requirements for controls and content that accepts user input.)
Time-Based Media:
If non-text content is time-based media, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content. (Refer to Guideline 1.2 for additional requirements for media.)
Test:
If non-text content is a test or exercise that would be invalid if presented in text, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content.
Sensory:
If non-text content is primarily intended to create a specific sensory experience, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content.
CAPTCHA:
If the purpose of non-text content is to confirm that content is being accessed by a person rather than a computer, then text alternatives that identify and describe the purpose of the non-text content are provided, and alternative forms of CAPTCHA using output modes for different types of sensory perception are provided to accommodate different disabilities.
Decoration, Formatting, Invisible:
If non-text content is pure decoration, is used only for visual formatting, or is not presented to users, then it is implemented in a way that it can be ignored by assistive technology.

Visual Presentation
Level AAA
For the visual presentation of blocks of text, a mechanism is available to achieve the following:
Foreground and background colors can be selected by the user.
Width is no more than 80 characters or glyphs (40 if CJK).
Text is not justified (aligned to both the left and the right margins).
Line spacing (leading) is at least space-and-a-half within paragraphs, and paragraph spacing is at least 1.5 times larger than the line spacing.
Text can be resized without assistive technology up to 200 percent in a way that does not require the user to scroll horizontally to read a line of text on a full-screen window.
Note 1:
Content is not required to use these values. The requirement is that a mechanism is available for users to change these presentation aspects. The mechanism can be provided by the browser or other user agent. Content is not required to provide the mechanism.
Note 2:
Writing systems for some languages use different presentation aspects to improve readability and legibility. If a presentation aspect in this success criterion is not used in a writing system, content in that writing system does not need to use that presentation setting and can conform without it. Authors are encouraged to follow guidance for improving readability and legibility of text in their writing system.

Content can be presented without loss of information or functionality, and without requiring scrolling in two dimensions for:
Vertical scrolling content at a width equivalent to 320 CSS pixels;
Horizontal scrolling content at a height equivalent to 256 CSS pixels.
Except for parts of the content which require two-dimensional layout for usage or meaning.
Note 1:
320 CSS pixels is equivalent to a starting viewport width of 1280 CSS pixels wide at 400% zoom. For web content which is designed to scroll horizontally (e.g., with vertical text), 256 CSS pixels is equivalent to a starting viewport height of 1024 CSS pixels at 400% zoom.
Note 2:
Examples of content which requires two-dimensional layout are images required for understanding (such as maps and diagrams), video, games, presentations, data tables (not individual cells), and interfaces where it is necessary to keep toolbars in view while manipulating content. It is acceptable to provide two-dimensional scrolling for such parts of the content.

Text Spacing
Level AA
(Added in 2.1)
In content implemented using markup languages that support the following text style properties, no loss of content or functionality occurs by setting all of the following and by changing no other style property:
Line height (line spacing) to at least 1.5 times the font size;
Spacing following paragraphs to at least 2 times the font size;
Letter spacing (tracking) to at least 0.12 times the font size;
Word spacing to at least 0.16 times the font size.
Exception: Human languages and scripts that do not make use of one or more of these text style properties in written text can conform using only the properties that exist for that combination of language and script.
Note 1:
Content is not required to use these text spacing values. The requirement is to ensure that when a user overrides the authored text spacing, content or functionality is not lost.
Note 2:
Writing systems for some languages use different text spacing settings, such as paragraph start indent. Authors are encouraged to follow locally available guidance for improving readability and legibility of text in their writing system.

Content on Hover or Focus
Level AA
(Added in 2.1)
Where receiving and then removing pointer hover or keyboard focus triggers additional content to become visible and then hidden, the following are true:
Dismissible:
A mechanism is available to dismiss the additional content without moving pointer hover or keyboard focus, unless the additional content communicates an input error or does not obscure or replace other content;
Hoverable:
If pointer hover can trigger the additional content, then the pointer can be moved over the additional content without the additional content disappearing;
Persistent:
The additional content remains visible until the hover or focus trigger is removed, the user dismisses it, or its information is no longer valid.
Exception: The visual presentation of the additional content is controlled by the user agent and is not modified by the author.
Note 1:
Examples of additional content controlled by the user agent include browser tooltips created through use of the
HTML
title attribute [
HTML
].
Note 2:
Custom tooltips, sub-menus, and other nonmodal popups that display on hover and focus are examples of additional content covered by this criterion.
Note 3:
This criterion applies to content that appears in addition to the triggering component itself. Since hidden components that are made visible on keyboard focus (such as links used to skip to another part of a page) do not present additional content they are not covered by this criterion.

Principle 2
– Operable
User interface components and navigation must be operable.
Guideline
2.1
– Keyboard Accessible
Make all functionality available from a keyboard.
2.1.1
Keyboard
Level A
All functionality of the content is operable through a keyboard interface without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes, except where the underlying function requires input that depends on the path of the user's movement and not just the endpoints.
Note 1:
This exception relates to the underlying function, not the input technique. For example, if using handwriting to enter text, the input technique (handwriting) requires path-dependent input but the underlying function (text input) does not.
Note 2:
This does not forbid and should not discourage providing mouse input or other input methods in addition to keyboard operation.

2.1.2
No Keyboard Trap
Level A
If keyboard focus can be moved to a component of the page using a keyboard interface, then focus can be moved away from that component using only a keyboard interface, and, if it requires more than unmodified arrow or tab keys or other standard exit methods, the user is advised of the method for moving focus away.
Note:
Since any content that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's ability to use the whole page, all content on the web page (whether it is used to meet other success criteria or not) must meet this success criterion. See Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference.

If a keyboard shortcut is implemented in content using only letter (including upper- and lower-case letters), punctuation, number, or symbol characters, then at least one of the following is true:
Turn off:
A mechanism is available to turn the shortcut off;
Remap:
A mechanism is available to remap the shortcut to include one or more non-printable keyboard keys (e.g., Ctrl, Alt);

Guideline
2.2
– Enough Time
Provide users enough time to read and use content.
2.2.1
Timing Adjustable
Level A
For each time limit that is set by the content, at least one of the following is true:
Turn off:
The user is allowed to turn off the time limit before encountering it; or
Adjust:
The user is allowed to adjust the time limit before encountering it over a wide range that is at least ten times the length of the default setting; or
Extend:
The user is warned before time expires and given at least 20 seconds to extend the time limit with a simple action (for example, "press the space bar"), and the user is allowed to extend the time limit at least ten times; or
Real-time Exception:
The time limit is a required part of a real-time event (for example, an auction), and no alternative to the time limit is possible; or
Essential Exception:
The time limit is essential and extending it would invalidate the activity; or
20 Hour Exception:
The time limit is longer than 20 hours.
Note:
This success criterion helps ensure that users can complete tasks without unexpected changes in content or context that are a result of a time limit. This success criterion should be considered in conjunction with Success Criterion 3.2.1, which puts limits on changes of content or context as a result of user action.

2.2.2
Pause, Stop, Hide
Level A
For moving, blinking, scrolling, or auto-updating information, all of the following are true:
Moving, blinking, scrolling:
For any moving, blinking or scrolling information that (1) starts automatically, (2) lasts more than five seconds, and (3) is presented in parallel with other content, there is a mechanism for the user to pause, stop, or hide it unless the movement, blinking, or scrolling is part of an activity where it is essential; and
Auto-updating:
For any auto-updating information that (1) starts automatically and (2) is presented in parallel with other content, there is a mechanism for the user to pause, stop, or hide it or to control the frequency of the update unless the auto-updating is part of an activity where it is essential.
Note 1:
For requirements related to flickering or flashing content, refer to Guideline 2.3.
Note 2:
Since any content that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's ability to use the whole page, all content on the web page (whether it is used to meet other success criteria or not) must meet this success criterion. See Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference.
Note 3:
Content that is updated periodically by software or that is streamed to the user agent is not required to preserve or present information that is generated or received between the initiation of the pause and resuming presentation, as this may not be technically possible, and in many situations could be misleading to do so.
Note 4:
An animation that occurs as part of a preload phase or similar situation can be considered essential if interaction cannot occur during that phase for all users and if not indicating progress could confuse users or cause them to think that content was frozen or broken.

This behavior might be encountered with advertising or promotional material meant to provide more information about a product as the user navigates through a catalogue.
A page has a sticky footer (attached to the bottom of the viewport). When tabbing down the page, a focused item is partially obscured by the footer because content in the viewport scrolls without sufficient
scroll padding
.

2.4.13
Focus Appearance
Level AAA
(Added in 2.2)
When the keyboard focus indicator is visible, an area of the focus indicator meets all the following:
is at least as large as the area of a 2 CSS pixel thick perimeter of the unfocused component or sub-component, and
has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 between the same pixels in the focused and unfocused states.
Exceptions:
The focus indicator is determined by the user agent and cannot be adjusted by the author, or
The focus indicator and the indicator's background color are not modified by the author.
Note 1:
What is perceived as the user interface component or sub-component (to determine the perimeter) depends on its visual presentation. The visual presentation includes the component's visible content, border, and component-specific background. It does not include shadow and glow effects outside the component's content, background, or border.
Note 2:
Examples of sub-components that may receive a focus indicator are menu items in an opened drop-down menu, or focusable cells in a grid.
Note 3:
Contrast calculations can be based on colors defined within the technology (such as
HTML
, CSS, and SVG). Pixels modified by user agent resolution enhancements and anti-aliasing can be ignored.

Pointer Cancellation
Level A
(Added in 2.1)
For functionality that can be operated using a single pointer, at least one of the following is true:
No Down-Event:
The down-event of the pointer is not used to execute any part of the function;
Abort or Undo:
Completion of the function is on the up-event, and a mechanism is available to abort the function before completion or to undo the function after completion;
Up Reversal:
The up-event reverses any outcome of the preceding down-event;
Essential:
Completing the function on the down-event is essential.
Note 1:
Functions that emulate a keyboard or numeric keypad key press are considered essential.

Target Size (Minimum)
Level AA
(Added in 2.2)
The size of the target for pointer inputs is at least 24 by 24 CSS pixels, except when:
Spacing:
Undersized targets (those less than 24 by 24 CSS pixels) are positioned so that if a 24 CSS pixel diameter circle is centered on the bounding box of each, the circles do not intersect another target or the circle for another undersized target;
Equivalent:
The function can be achieved through a different control on the same page that meets this criterion;
Inline:
The target is in a sentence or its size is otherwise constrained by the line-height of non-target text;
User Agent Control:
The size of the target is determined by the user agent and is not modified by the author;
Essential:
A particular presentation of the target is essential or is legally required for the information being conveyed.
Note 1:
Targets that allow for values to be selected spatially based on position within the target are considered one target for the purpose of the success criterion. Examples include sliders, color pickers displaying a gradient of colors, or editable areas where you position the cursor.
Note 2:
For inline targets the line-height should be interpreted as perpendicular to the flow of text. For example, in a language displayed vertically, the line-height would be horizontal.

for providing labels, names, and text alternatives
Note:
Text alternatives that are "consistent" are not always "identical." For instance, you may have a graphical arrow at the bottom of a web page that links to the next web page. The text alternative may say "Go to page 4." Naturally, it would not be appropriate to repeat this exact text alternative on the next web page. It would be more appropriate to say "Go to page 5". Although these text alternatives would not be identical, they would be consistent, and therefore would satisfy this success criterion.
A single non-text-content-item may be used to serve different functions. In such cases, different text alternatives are necessary and should be used. Examples can be commonly found with the use of icons such as check marks, cross marks, and traffic signs. Their functions can be different depending on the context of the web page. A check mark icon may function as "approved", "completed", or "included", to name a few, depending on the situation. Using "check mark" as text alternative across all web pages does not help users understand the function of the icon. Different text alternatives can be used when the same non-text content serves multiple functions.

If a web page contains any of the following help mechanisms, and those mechanisms are repeated on multiple web pages within a set of web pages, they occur in the same order relative to other page content, unless a change is initiated by the user:
Human contact details;
Human contact mechanism;
Self-help option;
A fully automated contact mechanism.
Note 1:
Help mechanisms may be provided directly on the page, or may be provided via a direct link to a different page containing the information.
Note 2:
For this success criterion, "the same order relative to other page content" can be thought of as how the content is ordered when the page is serialized. The visual position of a help mechanism is likely to be consistent across pages for the same page variation (e.g., CSS break-point). The user can initiate a change, such as changing the page's zoom or orientation, which may trigger a different page variation. This criterion is concerned with relative order across pages displayed in the same page variation (e.g., same zoom level and orientation).

Principle 4
– Robust
Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.
Guideline
4.1
– Compatible
Maximize compatibility with current and future user agents, including assistive technologies.
4.1.1
Parsing
Level A
In content implemented using markup languages, elements have complete start and end tags, elements are nested according to their specifications, elements do not contain duplicate attributes, and any IDs are unique, except where the specifications allow these features.
Note 1:
This success criterion should be considered as always satisfied for any content using HTML or XML.
Note 2:
Since this criterion was written, the HTML Living Standard has adopted specific requirements governing how user agents must handle incomplete tags, incorrect element nesting, duplicate attributes, and non-unique IDs. [
HTML
]
Although the HTML standard treats some of these cases as non-conforming for authors, it is considered to "allow these features" for the purposes of this success criterion because the specification requires that user agents support handling these cases consistently. In practice, this criterion no longer provides any benefit to people with disabilities in itself.
Issues such as missing roles due to inappropriately nested elements or incorrect states or names due to a duplicate ID are covered by different success criteria and should be reported under those criteria rather than as issues with 4.1.1.
Understanding 4.1.1
Back to top
4.1.2
Name, Role, Value
Level A
For all user interface components (including but not limited to: form elements, links and components generated by scripts), the name and role can be programmatically determined; states, properties, and values that can be set by the user can be programmatically set; and notification of changes to these items is available to user agents, including assistive technologies.
Note:
This success criterion is primarily for web authors who develop or script their own user interface components. For example, standard
HTML
controls already meet this success criterion when used according to specification.

for Success Criterion 4.1.2
Note: Other techniques may also be sufficient if they meet the success criterion. See
Understanding Techniques.
Situation A: If using a standard user interface component in a markup language (e.g., HTML):
ARIA14: Using aria-label to provide an invisible label where a visible label cannot be used
ARIA16: Using aria-labelledby to provide a name for user interface controls
G108: Using markup features to expose the name and role, allow user-settable properties to be directly set, and provide notification of changes
using one or more of the following techniques:
H91: Using HTML form controls and links
H44: Using label elements to associate text labels with form controls
H64: Using the title attribute of the iframe element
H65: Using the title attribute to identify form controls when the label element cannot be used
H88: Using HTML according to spec
Situation B: If using script or code to re-purpose a standard user interface component in a markup language:
Exposing the names and roles, allowing user-settable properties to be directly set, and providing notification of changes using one of the following techniques:
ARIA16: Using aria-labelledby to provide a name for user interface controls
Situation C: If using a standard user interface component in a programming technology:
G135: Using the accessibility API features of a technology to expose names and roles, to allow user-settable properties to be directly set, and to provide notification of changes
using one or more of the following techniques:
PDF10: Providing labels for interactive form controls in PDF documents
PDF12: Providing name, role, value information for form fields in PDF documents
Situation D: If creating your own user interface component in a programming language:
G10: Creating components using a technology that supports the accessibility API features of the platforms on which the user agents will be run to expose the names and roles, allow user-settable properties to be directly set, and provide notification of changes
using one or more of the following techniques:
ARIA4: Using a WAI-ARIA role to expose the role of a user interface component
ARIA5: Using WAI-ARIA state and property attributes to expose the state of a user interface component
ARIA16: Using aria-labelledby to provide a name for user interface controls
Failures
for Success Criterion 4.1.2
F59: Failure of Success Criterion 4.1.2 due to using script to make div or span a user interface control in HTML without providing a role for the control
F15: Failure of Success Criterion 4.1.2 due to implementing custom controls that do not use an accessibility API for the technology, or do so incompletely
F20: Failure of Success Criterion 1.1.1 and 4.1.2 due to not updating text alternatives when changes to non-text content occur
F42: Failure of Success Criteria 1.3.1, 2.1.1, 2.1.3, or 4.1.2 when emulating links
F68: Failure of Success Criterion 4.1.2 due to a user interface control not having a programmatically determined name
F79: Failure of Success Criterion 4.1.2 due to the focus state of a user interface component not being programmatically determinable or no notification of change of focus state available
F86: Failure of Success Criterion 4.1.2 due to not providing names for each part of a multi-part form field, such as a US telephone number
F89: Failure of Success Criteria 2.4.4, 2.4.9 and 4.1.2 due to not providing an accessible name for an image which is the only content in a link
F111: Failure of Success Criteria 1.3.1, 2.5.3, and 4.1.2 due to a control with visible label text but no accessible name

Note:
Not all examples in the preceding general techniques use status messages to convey warnings or errors to users. A role of "alert" is only necessary where a change of context does
not
take place.
