- C40: Creating a two-color focus indicator to ensure sufficient contrast with all components
- G183: Using a contrast ratio of 3:1 with surrounding text and providing additional visual cues on hover for links or controls where color alone is used to identify them
- The visual presentation of the following have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against adjacent color(s):
- has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 between the same pixels in the focused and unfocused states.
- The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for the following:
- Large-scale text and images of large-scale text have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1;
- G18: Ensuring that a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 exists between text (and images of text) and background behind the text
- G145: Ensuring that a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 exists between text (and images of text) and background behind the text
- The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 7:1, except for the following:
- Large-scale text and images of large-scale text have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1;
- G17: Ensuring that a contrast ratio of at least 7:1 exists between text (and images of text) and background behind the text
- G207: Ensuring that a contrast ratio of 3:1 is provided for icons
- G138: Using semantic markup whenever color cues are used
- First Requirement: Techniques to ensure foreground and background colors can be selected by the user
- Fourth Requirement: Techniques to ensure line spacing (leading) is at least space-and-a-half within paragraphs, and paragraph spacing is at least 1.5 times larger than the line spacing
- G209: Provide sufficient contrast at the boundaries between adjoining colors
- The requirement is to ensure that when a user overrides the authored text spacing, content or functionality is not lost.
- C39: Using the CSS prefers-reduced-motion query to prevent motion
- SCR40: Using the CSS prefers-reduced-motion query in JavaScript to prevent motion
- Gx: Allowing users to set a preference that prevents animation
- The motion is used to operate functionality through an accessibility supported interface;
- C42: Using min-height and min-width to ensure sufficient target spacing
- The earlier techniques are preferred because they increase accessibility to a wider user group.
- Instructions provided for understanding and operating content do not rely solely on sensory characteristics of components such as shape, color, size, visual location, orientation, or sound.
