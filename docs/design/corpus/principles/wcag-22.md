- has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 between the same pixels in the focused and unfocused states.
- This information should be provided in a form that users can use, preferably machine-readable metadata.
- text and images of large-scale text have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1;
- text and images of large-scale text have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1;
- Contrast ratios can range from 1 to 21 (commonly written 1:1 to 21:1).
- Web accessibility depends not only on accessible content but also on accessible web browsers and other user agents.
- The 13 guidelines provide the basic goals that authors should work toward in order to make content more accessible to users with different disabilities.
- , as well as to seek relevant advice about current best practice to ensure that web content is accessible, as far as possible, to this community.
- The requirement is to ensure that when a user overrides the authored text spacing, content or functionality is not lost.
- A list of specific accessibility characteristics of the content, provided in machine-readable metadata.
- The web content technology must have accessibility-supported user agents that are

- advises the use of WCAG 2.2 to maximize future applicability of accessibility efforts.
- also encourages use of the most current version of WCAG when developing or updating web accessibility policies.
- At the top are four principles that provide the foundation for web accessibility:
- All of these layers of guidance (principles, guidelines, success criteria, and sufficient and advisory techniques) work together to provide guidance on how to make content more accessible.
- The Working Group also used a less formal set of acceptance criteria for success criteria, to help ensure success criteria are similar in style and quality to those in WCAG 2.0.
- The Working Group considers that WCAG 2.2 incrementally advances web content accessibility guidance for all these areas, but underscores that not all user needs are met by these guidelines.
- In order to avoid confusion for implementers for whom backwards compatibility to WCAG 2 versions is important, new success criteria in WCAG 2.2 have been appended to the end of the set of success criteria within their guideline.
- The work follows a research-focused, user-centered design methodology to produce the most effective and flexible outcome, including the roles of content authoring, user agent support, and authoring tool support.
- This is a multi-year effort, so WCAG 2.2 is needed as an interim measure to provide updated web accessibility guidance to reflect changes on the web since the publication of WCAG 2.0.
- Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an
- Foreground and background colors can be selected by the user.
- Content is not required to use these text spacing values.
