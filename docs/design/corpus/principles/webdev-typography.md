- Responsive typography is also about respecting the user's device and network connection.
- So text on the web is responsive by default—it flows to fit the user's viewport.
- There's more to typography than choosing suitable fonts to use.
- A more responsive approach is to let the user's device width influence the text size.
- Remember to prioritize hierarchy as you build your user interfaces for better clarity and page flow.
